            i do commissions! it may raise the price based on what you order,
            but it won't be by too much! 
            commissions aren't too different from what i already do, but they're a little more difficult.
            with comms, i need a color scheme, type of jewelry, size, and charms. examples for what to say are:
            pink and green color scheme, charm necklace, xx inches around, and nature charms.
            make sure to be specific with what you do and don't want!
            i dont do refunds, but i can always alter what ive made to fit you more.
